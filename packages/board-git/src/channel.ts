// `channel.ts` — the BoardChannel seam (board-git PR B, plans/board-git-package): a READ-ONLY

// the provisioning state machine: callers run it AFTER `retargetBoardInterior` and the heal/repair
// steps (`healStaleRebaseBeforeProvisioning`, `provisionBoardWorktree`'s worktree repair), and it
// never mutates anything — no fetch, no ref deletion, no repair. It may DESCRIBE a state the
// provisioning machine refuses; it must never re-route that machine's reviewed guidance.
//
// Rule 1 keys on the WEAK structural signature (worktree machinery owned by this repo — the
// porcelain signature helpers), NEVER `isProvisioned`: a rebase detaches HEAD, so a genuinely
// provisioned but wedged-mid-rebase board is never "on the board branch" until healed — keying on
// the branch would misclassify it as not-branch and regress the heal pipeline (this exact
// misclassification was fixed over multiple historical review rounds).
//
// Remote-unknown FAILS CLOSED (plans/board-git-package, second review required change 1):
// "definitively absent" requires a probe that SUCCEEDED; a dead probe with no previously fetched
// evidence is a typed INDETERMINATE outcome — never "absent", never `in-tree`, never `local-only`.
// Classifying uncertainty as in-tree could hide an existing shared board and create two competing
// board locations once connectivity returns.
