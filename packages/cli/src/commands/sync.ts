// `agentstate-lite sync` — share the board branch with a remote (U3a core flow + U3b conflict

//
// FLOW (full sync; `--pull-only` skips steps 2 and 4):
//   0. entry self-heal (adjudication C): a stale mid-rebase state found at ENTRY (a crashed/killed
//      prior run) is aborted BEFORE the commit step — a wedged worktree kills commit first.
//   1. provision the board worktree (U1 self-heal, `provisionBoardWorktree`).
//   2. commit (`stageAndCommit`; skip-empty).
//   3. pull — full sync: `rebase origin/board` with the CONVERGING conflict mechanic
//      (`fetchRebaseResolving`, U3b: keep upstream, export local, COMPLETE the rebase — replaces
//      U3a's detect-and-abort interim guard). `--pull-only`: `merge --ff-only origin/board`
//      (`ffPull`) — NEVER rebase.
//   4. push (`push`). A run that resolved conflicts SKIPS the push and exits CONFLICT(5) with the
//      amended pack (c) envelope — the documented reconcile chain's next `sync` pushes everything.
//   5. envelope + awareness cache write (U2's cursor/cache/marker store — consumed by U4).
//
// `sync --show-incoming <id>` (U3b) is the conflict VIEWER: prints the upstream version of one doc
// via `git show origin/board:<path>` with full doc-read semantics (truncation, `--out` byte hatch,
// `--out -` stderr envelope), labeled "as of last fetch" (no implicit fetch — adjudication G).
//
// COMMAND LAYER ONLY: this module composes `@agentstate-lite/board-git`'s exported vocabulary —
// porcelain ops, the diff family, the flow steps, the neutral engine helpers — plus the CLI's
// store wiring (`cursor.ts`), but never re-implements git plumbing or the state-store schema.
// This module keeps COMMAND UX: arg parsing, envelopes, help text, and the git tier's CLI
// command boundary (BoardGitError → CliError, see `sync()`).
//
// TWO CALLERS, ONE `ffPull` PRIMITIVE, DIFFERENT TOLERANCE: U1's `ffPull` is deliberately fail-soft
// (its own header: "must never throw and never block a render") for U4's SessionStart caller. THIS
// command is the OTHER caller of the SAME primitive and has the OPPOSITE posture: `--pull-only` is
// an interactive verb that must report a REAL structured outcome, so `ffSwallowToError` below
// translates every `FfPullResult.swallowed` reason into the capped CliError taxonomy instead of
// silently no-op'ing.

export const SYNC_USAGE = `agentstate-lite sync — share the board branch with a remote (git tier)

Usage:
  agentstate-lite sync [--pull-only] [--dir <path>] [--limit <n>] [--json]
  agentstate-lite sync --establish [--yes] [--dir <path>] [--json]
  agentstate-lite sync --show-incoming <id> [--out <file>] [--dir <path>] [--json]

Shares this repo's board (\`.agentstate-lite\`, kept on its own \`board\` branch) with your
teammates: ordinary sync commits pending local doc changes, pulls theirs, and pushes yours without
touching code files. The one-time \`--establish\` transition also appends the board path to the
root working-tree \`.gitignore\` and reports that edit. \`--pull-only\` skips commit + push and
only fast-forwards from origin
(never rebases) — the mode a read-only session uses to pick up incoming changes without
publishing local ones.

\`init\` creates a LOCAL bundle; sharing it is a separate, explicit act. \`sync --establish\` turns
this project's local \`.agentstate-lite/\` into the shared board: it snapshots and publishes the
bundle, then checks out the new \`board\` branch at the same path — never automatic, never inferred
from a bare \`sync\` (which never publishes a bundle nobody has chosen to share). Once established
(here or by a teammate), plain \`sync\` is everyone's setup AND ongoing verb: on a project that
already shares a board, it provisions the local checkout, then commits, pulls, and pushes ordinary
board changes.
\`--establish\` on an already-established project is a safe no-op that notes \`already established\`
and proceeds as an ordinary sync.

On a repo that has never had the board checkout materialized locally (a fresh clone, or the first
\`aslite\` invocation after one), sync provisions \`.agentstate-lite\` itself from \`origin/board\` —
never silently: the receipt carries a \`provisioned: <path>\` line. If the checkout already exists
but its pointers went stale (e.g. it was moved or remounted at a different path), sync self-heals
it via \`git worktree repair\` and reports \`repaired: <path>\` the same way — a repair is a git
mutation too, and both lines appear even on an otherwise-empty run.

Three definitive empty states (exit 0): no git repo — or a repo with neither a board branch nor
a bundle — prints 'sync: nothing to sync'; a repo whose bundle is known to have no board branch
anywhere is a LOCAL-ONLY board; a clean shared board prints 'sync: already up to date'. If origin
cannot be checked and no board ref is available, sync reports the shared-board state as unknown
and recommends retrying when origin is reachable.
Otherwise the receipt reports { committed, pushed, pulled, actor, incoming } — \`incoming\` is the
enriched delta of docs that arrived this run (capped; --limit controls the row cap, default 20).

When a doc changed on BOTH sides, sync CONVERGES: your teammate's version is kept on the board,
YOUR version is saved to an export file named in the receipt, and the sync completes (the
board is never left mid-state; non-conflicted local changes still land). The run exits 5 with
one row per conflicted doc and the reconcile chain: \`sync --show-incoming <id>\` to view the kept
incoming version, \`doc update <id> --body-file <export-file>\` to write your merged version on
top, then \`sync\` again to share it.

\`sync --show-incoming <id>\` prints the board's incoming (upstream) version of one doc — the
state of \`origin/board\` as of the last fetch (it never fetches). Full doc-read semantics: large
bodies truncate and point at \`--out <file>\` (raw bytes to disk); \`--out -\` streams the raw
bytes to stdout with the receipt (or any error envelope) on stderr. A doc absent upstream renders
as an expected state, not an error.

If the push fails after a local commit already landed (offline, revoked/expired credentials, or a
locked repository), the receipt still reports what committed/pulled successfully — your work is
saved locally either way, and re-running sync retries the push.

A board can also ride IN-TREE: \`.agentstate-lite/\` committed WITH the code on the current
branch, with no dedicated \`board\` branch anywhere. That is a supported, read-side mode — sync
recognizes it and behaves accordingly: \`sync --pull-only\` fetches the branch's own tracking
upstream and reports incoming board doc changes (your normal \`git pull\` delivers them);
\`session-start\`/\`home\` show the same upstream awareness; \`--show-incoming <id>\` reads the
upstream version. Sharing YOUR board changes rides your normal commit/push — a full \`sync\`
refuses (it would have to publish the code branch itself) and \`sync --establish\` remains the
explicit conversion to a dedicated \`board\` branch. If the branch has no upstream (or a detached
HEAD), in-tree awareness honestly reports that there is no comparison basis rather than guessing.

Board-READING commands (\`list\`, \`doc read\`, \`status\`, \`home\`, \`link show\`) also keep a
provisioned board fresh opportunistically: when the board's awareness state is older than ~5
minutes, the read first runs the same fast-forward-only pull \`--pull-only\` uses (time-boxed to
~2s; never a rebase, never provisioning, silent on any failure) and then serves fresh state — so
the board checkout's HEAD can advance after a plain \`list\`. Reads never auto-push; sharing YOUR
changes is always this verb. Set AGENTSTATE_LITE_NO_AUTOPULL to any non-empty value to disable
the auto-pull (note: "0" disables it too — the variable's PRESENCE is the switch) for CI or
scripted runs that must never touch the network.

\`--establish\` also handles the project whose \`.agentstate-lite/\` folder is ALREADY COMMITTED
on the current branch: it creates the \`board\` branch carrying the folder's CURRENT files (files
only — the folder's history stays where it is), pushes it to origin with tracking, and prepares
ONE local commit on a new \`board-cleanup\` branch that removes the folder from the current branch
and gitignores it — you push that branch and open the PR yourself; nothing on the current branch
is pushed or changed. Until that PR merges the old committed folder is a frozen snapshot: sync no
longer updates it, so treat it as read-only. Without \`--yes\`, the committed case prints a
preview (a dry run, including the rollout note to send teammates) and changes nothing. It refuses
while \`.agentstate-lite/\` has uncommitted changes, when the current branch is behind origin on
commits touching the folder (pull first — a teammate's board commit must never be stranded on
the frozen copy), when origin is unreachable (the freshness check and the push both need it),
and when any \`board/...\` branch exists locally or on the remote (git cannot create a \`board\`
branch alongside them). It reports 'already established' (exit 0) once a board branch exists on
origin — with state-aware guidance, including re-creating the folder-removal commit when an
interrupted run left it missing. Coordinate first: every board writer syncs (at minimum commits)
their board work before anyone establishes.

Two edge states are ACCEPTED rather than auto-resolved. (1) On a case-insensitive filesystem, a
committed folder whose name differs from \`.agentstate-lite\` only by case (a state this CLI never
creates) can misroute establishment — rename it to the exact lowercase spelling first. (2) Deleting
the remote \`board\` branch in the middle of the both-worlds window (a deliberate, destructive,
out-of-band act) leaves the prepared cleanup PR pointing at a board that no longer exists — do not
merge that PR; re-run \`sync --establish\` to publish the board again first.

Options:
  --pull-only          Only fast-forward from origin (never rebase); skip commit + push
  --establish          Explicitly publish this project's bundle as its shared board (a folder
                       already committed on the branch is handled too — preview first)
  --yes                Execute the committed-folder establishment (without it, that case prints
                       a preview and changes nothing; the uncommitted case never needs it)
  --show-incoming <id> Print the upstream (origin/board) version of one doc, as of the last fetch
  --out <file>         With --show-incoming: write the raw bytes to <file> ('-' = raw to stdout)
  --dir <path>         Directory to run sync from (default: the cwd) — must be inside a git repo
  --limit <n>          Cap the incoming-delta row list to <n> rows (default: 20; 0 = unlimited)
  --json               Emit compact JSON instead of TOON
