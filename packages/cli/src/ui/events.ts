// calls {@link SseHub.broadcast}; the shell then fans each change into subscribed iframes over the
// postMessage bridge. Kept deliberately tiny — one Set of live node responses, no per-client
// queueing (a change event is a delta the shell refetches against, so a dropped frame self-heals
// on the next one).
